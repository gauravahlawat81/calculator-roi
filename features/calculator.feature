Feature: Calculator
    As a user
    I want to use a calculator to do math
    So I get more accurate answers than if I did the math manually

    Scenario: Add 2 and 3
        Given I have a calculator
        When I add 2 and 3
        Then the result should be 5

     Scenario Outline: Add two numbers <num1> and <num2>
        Given I have a calculator
        When I add <num1> and <num2>
        Then the result should be <total>

         Examples:
            | num1 | num2 | total |
            | 2    | 3    | 5     |
            | -2   | 3    | 1     |
            | 10   | 15   | 25    |
            | 99   | -99  | 0     |
            | -1   | -10  | -11   |
            | 0    | 0    | 0     |
            | 0    | 5    | 5     |
            | 7    | 0    | 7     |
            | -3   | 0    | -3    |
